Free verse by Anonymous

the musing is exceptionally brooding.
Does the musing make you shiver?
does it?

the testament is the most lasting sacred text of all.
Does the testament make you shiver?
does it?

Just like a melancholy impression, is the contemplation.
A contemplation is cockamamie. a contemplation is foolish,
a contemplation is cuckoo, however.
